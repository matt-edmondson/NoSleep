"""Draws the NoSleep tray icons and the NuGet package icon.

The mark is an eye: open and amber while NoSleep is holding an inhibitor, closed and grey while the
machine is free to sleep. Tray panels come in every shade, so the shapes are solid colour on
transparency with no background tile, and the open/closed silhouette carries the state even where a
panel renders the icon in monochrome.

Run from the repository root:

    python3 scripts/generate-icons.py

Requires Pillow. Every shape is drawn at 4x and downsampled, which is what keeps the 16px tray
rendering legible.
